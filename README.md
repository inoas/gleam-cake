## Name

The best part of working with CakePHP 3+ used to be its Query Builder. This library is inspired by that and thus the name.

Thank you [@lorenzo](https://github.com/lorenzo) and [@markstory](https://github.com/markstory) for creating and maintaining CakePHP and its awesome query builder over the years.
